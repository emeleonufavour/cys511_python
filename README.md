# Python code to crack group passwords in CYS 511 practical class

I wrote the contents in this repo to hack the passwords of all groups in the fastest amount of time
possible as the requirements for winning. 

## How to use
- The shadow.txt file has its contents gotten from the shadow file in the /etc/shadow directory in Linux.
- The firstname.py file contains a map of each group number to its members
- Modify any of the two above files for the password you want to crack with the password_crack.py file
